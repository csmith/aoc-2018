# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my solution to 2018's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) puzzles. The solutions
are all written in Python 3; one or two may require the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) package, but the rest should
work out-of-the-box.

If you have docker installed, simply execute `run.sh` to build a docker image and execute the latest solution
using pypy3. You can specify other days by passing the script names as arguments (e.g. `run.sh 03.py`).

I tend to focus on short, functional solutions where possible, so they may be a bit hard to read. Some solutions are
commented to some degree to help with that.

I have separate repositories for solutions from previous years:
  - [2017](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2017)
  - [2016](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2016)
  - [2015](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2015)
