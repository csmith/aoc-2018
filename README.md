# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my solution to 2018's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) puzzles in Nim.

The easiest way to run these is using docker -- simply execute `run.sh <day>` to build a docker image and execute the
specific day.

I have separate repositories for solutions from previous years:
  - [2017](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2017) (All python)
  - [2016](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2016) (All python)
  - [2015](https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2015) (All python)
